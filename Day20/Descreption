The third line contains an integer,  (the number of queries).
The  subsequent lines describe the queries, and each query is described over two lines:

If the first line of a query contains the String Insert, then the second line contains two space separated integers , and the value  must be inserted into  at index .
If the first line of a query contains the String Delete, then the second line contains index , whose element must be deleted from .
