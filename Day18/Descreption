The first line contains an integer,q , denoting the number of queries (i.e., function calls).
The 2. q subsequent lines describe each query over two lines:

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  and .
The second line contains  space-separated binary integers (i.e., zeroes and ones) describing the respective values of .
Constraints

It is guaranteed that the value of  is always .
